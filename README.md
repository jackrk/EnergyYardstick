EnergyYardstick
===============

The City of Ames Energy Yardstick application will provide residents of Ames with personalized energy efficiency metrics based on past usage and other variables. User's will be able to compare their rating to 'similar' houses (in terms of size, number of occupants, etc), and also to the average for this area. Finally, they can access historical usage data for their account.

This tool will be hosted on a PHP server provisioned by the City, and the city plans to have our tool available for users directly from their main website.
